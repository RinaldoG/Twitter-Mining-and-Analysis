McPherson College Bulldog’s Twitter account has been examined through careful analysis. With simple key
steps, turning the account into a Twitter account with a large Twitter presence should be simple.
* Tweet Production: We suggest a focus on more original content, promoting and advertising the College’s
sporting teams. This incorporates an increase in the frequency of tweets, ranging around 55
tweets per week, and special consideration when retweeting and replying to other users.
* Third-party applications: McPherson College Bulldogs’ Twitter account could implement stronger use
of Twitter Media Studio as well as potential third-party applications for the production of its tweets.
This will ensure production of on a wide variety of content as well as the analytical management of
video engagement and monetizing of the account to increase the college’s sporting revenue. The use of
third-party applications will also allow for tweet scheduling as future planning and ‘hype’ of sporting
programs are seen to be an important part of a sporting Twitter account.
* Hashtag presence: McPherson College Bulldogs’ Twitter account could potentially update its Hashtag
presence within its Twitter account. This could involve establishing a new main hashtag to pursue
heavily while adopting smaller hashtags to broaden the Twitter presence of McPherson College.
* Tweet Wording Choice: The Bulldogs’ Twitter account should continue its positive wording presence
on Twitter while also encompassing joyful words to set apart McPherson College from the rest. The
Twitter account can also start to incorporate ‘anticipation’ wording choice within the tweets regarding
the outlook of the sporting program for a general enticement of its followers.
